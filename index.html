            <h4>AI-based chest X-ray solution</h4>
            <p>
              The interpretation of chest radiographs is a challenging task,
              requiring experience and expertise. Studies have reported
              suboptimal performance in the interpretation of chest radiographs
              by physicians compared with expert radiologists. However, there is
              a practical limitation with regard to the full-time availability
              of expert radiologists, especially for after-hours coverage.
              Diagnosis through imaging, with its emphasis on identifying subtle
              patterns that can be hard to detect with the human eye, makes for
              an ideal use case for AI based disease diagnostic system. We use
              artificial intelligence to help doctors to make decisions by
              analyzing x-rays of the patients. Our product classifies 15
              different classes of lungs disease using frontal chest x-ray with
              the help of Deep Neural Network architecture
